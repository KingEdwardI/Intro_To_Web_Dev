			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support,
				and abandoned browsers.</p>
			<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the
				W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators.
			</p>
			<p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity.
				Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>
		</div>

		<!--
		The rest of this is for styling later, and follows the same pattern.
		Take a few minutes to look through this and get familiar with the syntax

				<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
				<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation.
					To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very
					page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
				</p>
				<p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in
					a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those
					able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always
					push it further.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements">
				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 &amp; 2 usage. CSS 3 &amp; 4 should be limited to widely-supported
					elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not
					the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your
					CSS validates.</p>
				
				<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines
					you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the
					web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across
					every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the
					latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
				
				<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum,
					and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing
					another garden-related design.</p>
				
				<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions,
					see, but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</p>
